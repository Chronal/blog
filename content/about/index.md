### Who am I?
Hi, I'm Anuj! This is my litte corner of the web.

I'll be writing about things I find interesting, primarily in the realm of computer science, physics and maths.

At the moment, I'm taking a break from software development work and university to spend time learning things myself. Namely:
- Distributed Systems
- Operating Systems
- Set Theory
